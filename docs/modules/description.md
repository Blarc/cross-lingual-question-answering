# Description
This repository contains the implementation of related [article](../../article/report.pdf) that was written as a part
of *Natural Language Processing* course at the *Faculty of Computer and Information Science at the 
University of Ljubljana*.

The goal of the project is to prepare an english, slovene and multilingual english and slovene model for question 
answering system. Stanford Question Answering Dataset ([SQuAD 2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/))
